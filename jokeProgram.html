				<h2>Joke Program Maker</h2>

				<p>This simplistic program creates a cpp file filled with 40,000 lines of code.
                The approximate value in bytes is 950,000.</p>

                <p>This small program was created because, while I was browsing
                    through projects made by others on GitHub I encountered a simple
                    Python script whose only function was multiplying numbers from 1
                    to 100. What interested me was that the script was made of a few lines
                    of code that took input from the user, followed by about 10,000 lines
                    of brute force using if statements. It was likely made as a joke
                    and while considering the methods in which it was created, I decided
                    to conduct a little experiment as well. This project was the
                    product.</p>

				<p>This program has been tested on macOS and Xubuntu.</p>

                <p>In order to use this project, please compile the program, run it,
                    then comile the output.</p>
