				<h2>Basic Ray Tracer</h2>

				<p>This program is a simple but thorough ray tracer that can draw
                scenes with 3-D objects, a camera and multiple lights.</p>

                <p>This program is the third project of my graphics course. I have
                labeled the functions I have completed at the bottom of the gfxraytrace.hpp
                file. The gfxalgebra.hpp file was the course's second project which
                contains the matrix and vector algebra.</p>

                <p>The project was given with plenty of already made code. In order to work
                with the given code I had to read and understand what has been done so far
                and what the unfinished areas are purposed for.</p>

				<p>This program has been tested on Xubuntu. Unfortunately, since the program
                was meant for Linux, the makefile contains apt-get commands for automatic
                installation of the tools necessary, such as the google test library, cmake,
                and the png creater library for C++ (libpng++). It will not work as intended,
                on other non-linux OS without further work.</p>

				<p>There is a GitHub repository for this project,
                    but it made under a private organization.</p>
