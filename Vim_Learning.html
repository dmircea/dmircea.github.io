				<h2>Learning Vim</h2>

                <br/>

                <h3>About Vim</h3>
                <p>Vim is a text-editor, derived from the orignal Vi. It is available
                as a GUI application, but was originally developed for the terminal.
                It is an open-source application that is automatically installed
                in most Linux operatins systems and in every copy of macOS. Additionally,
                it is available for download on most other OS including Windows.</p>

                <p>Utilizing Vim can maximize productivity, since all shortcuts and
                key-bindings are designed in order to keep the typers hands on the
                keyboard, and not have them wander over a mouse or on the arrow keys.
                However it is also very difficult to learn how to use Vim, since
                memorizing all the key shortcuts must be done over the course of time.
                </p>

                <h3>My interest in Vim</h3>
                <p>I spent a good amount of time on the terminal with my projects,
                and decided that learning Vim can be helpful for tweaking the files,
                searching for important bits of information, especially because it
                is used by default in many programs (GitHub commit command will automatically
                open an instance Vim for the message, as an example.)</p>
                <p>Also it seems to be pretty fun.</p>

				<h3>Vim Modes</h3>
				<p>Vim has a set of modes that can be use to simplify text editing
				while upholding the same ammount of productivity from the users.</p>

				<section>
					<div class="table-wrapper">
						<table>
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th>Mode</th>
									<th>Description</th>
								</tr>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>Normal</td>
									<td>This is what Vim starts in. This mode is used to move quickly through the text.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Insert</td>
									<td>This mode is used for actual typing. Once the place where typing must be done the insert
										mode is used to change the functionalities of the keys. Escape or Control + [ is used to
										leave insert mode, back into normal mode.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Visual</td>
									<td>This mode is used for simplifying more complex selections.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Visual Block</td>
									<td>This mode is derived from the visual mode, but instead selects text by block.
										It's selection forms a rectangle around the selected area defined by
										the width and length from where the user entered into visual block mode.</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
					</div>
				</section>

                <h3>Vim Commands</h3>
                <p>Lasty, I made this page as my personal reminder of all the shortcuts
                that can be used in Vim and how they are used.</p>
